extends CanvasLayer
# skills_bar.gd - the skills bar presents skills at the bottom of the screen,
# and is parented to the HUD. By default it only shows an 'interact' skill
# (which is rendered as disabled when there is nothing to interact with), but
# additional skills that are learnt around the Lattice, such as gliding, will
# appear here. They should show the relevant input key.
