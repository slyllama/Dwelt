        <h1>Dwelt Technical Test Notes</h1>

        <!--<p><strong>An environment-driven puzzle RPG about robot cartels and essences of emotion.</strong> In the world of <em>Dwelt</em>, the valuable essences of emotion trafficked by the Order of Scrappers are locked within portals to strange landscapes of memory and feeling, which line the walls of their infinitely labyrinthine dwelling. In order to unlock and extract this essence and trade it on a lucrative black market, you and your cohort must negotiate the emotional skeletons of these geographies, bringing them closure by traversing their spans and depths, and solving the puzzles and riddles which encapsulate their feelings, hopes, and trauma. Yet questions remain: what are these portals? Where do they come from?</p>
        
        <p>And how is it even possible that you, Scrapper, are here to gaze upon a labyrinth torn from the universe by the Cosmos Itself?</p>

        <p>Welcome to the <em>Dwelt</em> technical test! This build contains no setting or narrative content - it's just a test of the mechanics used to tell the story of the Scrappers and those who dwell amongst the Lattice. <strong>Your help in trialing these features, attempting novel combinations of actions, and documenting the bugs that result, will be invaluable in stabilising this world and readying it to be painted in.</strong> Checking that saving and loading is robust, combining unforseen actions (for instance, initiating a skill simultaneously from two different inputs), and tests like these will be very helpful.</p>

			<h3>1.0.2 Release Notes</h3>
			
			<p style="color:red; margin: 10px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px;">Running this version will reset your old save and settings. This will only happen during pre-release development.</p>
			
			<ul>
                <li>Fixed an issue causing lower FPS values to result in sluggish movement. Slight tweaks to movement dynamics - more speed; reduced slipperiness.</li>
                <li>Adjusted some visual effects to be more subtle. Various minor fixes.</li>
			</ul>

        <h3>Notes For Testers</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Press <b>F2</b> to open the debugging menu, which lets you reset your save, hide the player model, and other useful things like that.</li>
            <li>Settings, save data, and shader caches are stored in your <code>AppData/Roaming/dwelt</code> folder. You can safely delete everything in here, which might be useful if the program gets totally stuck.</li>
            <li>Please quote the version number always shown in the bottom right of the game when reporting issues and improvements!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>And thank you so much for your interest and patience! &hearts; <i>&mdash;slyllama</i></p>
