# Dwelt

**An environment-driven puzzle RPG about robot cartels and essences of emotion.** In the world of _Dwelt_, the valuable essences of emotion trafficked by the Order of Scrappers are locked within portals to strange landscapes of memory and feeling, which line the walls of their infinitely labyrinthine dwelling. In order to unlock and extract this essence and trade it on a lucrative black market, you and your cohort must negotiate the emotional skeletons of these geographies, bringing them closure by traversing their spans and depths, and solving the puzzles and riddles which encapsulate their feelings, hopes, and trauma. Yet questions remain: what are these portals? Where do they come from?

And how is it even possible that you, Scrapper, are here to gaze upon a labyrinth torn from the universe by the Cosmos Itself?

## Technical Test Notes

Welcome to the _Dwelt_ technical test! This build contains no setting or narrative content - it's just a test of the mechanics used to tell the story of the Scrappers and those who dwell amongst the Lattice. __Your help in trialing these features, attempting novel combinations of actions, and documenting the bugs that result, will be invaluable in stabilising this world and readying it to be painted in.__ Checking that saving and loading is robust, combining unforseen actions (for instance, initiating a skill simultaneously from two different inputs), and tests like these will be very helpful.
